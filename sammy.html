    <p>
      Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American politician, media
      personality, and businessman who is the 47th president of the United
      States. A member of the Republican Party, he served as the 45th president
      from 2017 to 2021.

      into a wealthy New York City family,Trump graduated from the University of
      Pennsylvania in 1968 with a bachelor's degree in economics. He became the
      president of his family's real estate business in 1971, renamed it the
      Trump Organization, and began acquiring and building skyscrapers, hotels,
      casinos, and golf courses. He launched side ventures, many licensing the
      Trump name, and filed for six business bankruptcies in the 1990s and
      2000s. From 2004 to 2015, he hosted the reality television show The
      Apprentice, bolstering his fame as a billionaire. Presenting himself as a
      political outsider, Trump won the 2016 presidential election against
      Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton.

      During his first presidency, Trump imposed a travel ban on seven
      Muslim-majority countries, expanded the Mexico United States border wall,
      and enforced a family separation policy on the border. He rolled back
      environmental and business regulations, signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,
      and appointed three Supreme Court justices. In foreign policy, Trump
      withdrew the U.S. from agreements on climate, trade, and Iran's nuclear
      program, and initiated a trade war with China. In response to the COVID-19
      pandemic in 2020, he downplayed its severity, contradicted health
      officials, and signed the CARES Act. After losing the 2020 presidential
      election to Joe Biden, Trump attempted to overturn the result, culminating
      in the January 6 Capitol attack in 2021. He was impeached in 2019 for
      abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and in 2021 for incitement of
      insurrection; the Senate acquitted him both times.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2023, Trump was found liable in civil cases for sexual abuse and
      defamation and for business fraud. He was found guilty in 34 counts of
      falsifying business records in 2024, making him the first U.S. president
      convicted of a felony. After winning the 2024 presidential election
      against Vice President Kamala Harris, he was sentenced to a discharge, and
      two federal felony indictments against him for retention of classified
      documents and obstruction of the 2020 election were dismissed without
      prejudice.
    </p>
    <p style="background-color: yellow;color: blue;">
      Trump began his second presidency by initiating mass layoffs of federal
      workers. He imposed tariffs on nearly all countries at the highest level
      since the Great Depression and signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. His
      administration's actions including its targeting of political opponents
      and civil society, persecution of transgender people, mass deportation of
      immigrants, and extensive use of executive orders have drawn over 550
      lawsuits challenging their legality.
